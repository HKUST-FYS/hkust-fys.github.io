This title policy determines the format of page title, section title, filenames, and folder names.

## Title Casing

For page titles and section titles, we follow the the [_Associated Press Stylebook_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook). Apply the following rules with higher ones overriding lower ones:

- Capitalize the first and last words.
- Capitalize principal words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns), including every part of a hyphenated word.
- Capitalize prepositions and conjunctions of four letters or more.
- Capitalize the "to" in infinitives.
- Lowercase the articles "the", "a", and "an".

## Filenames and Folder Names

For filenames and folder names, we use mid-sentence case and snake_casing. This means proper nouns and some specified words are capitalized, and all spaces are replaced by underscores.
