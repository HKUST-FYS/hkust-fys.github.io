This title policy determines the format of page title, section title, filenames, and folder names.

## Title Casing

For page titles and section titles, we follow the the [_Associated Press Stylebook_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook). Apply the following rules with higher ones overriding lower ones:

- Capitalize the first and last words.
- Capitalize the principal words
- Capitalize prepositions and conjunctions of four letters or more.
- Lowercase the articles `the`, `a`, and `an`.
- Capitalize the "to" in infinitives.
