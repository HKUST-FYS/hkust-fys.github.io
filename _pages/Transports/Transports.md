title: Transports @HKUST
---

HKUST, unlike other universities, does not have railway support. All transports of HKUST heavily depends on buses and minibuses. Here we are going to introduce different transports to HKUST.

## Diamond Hill and Choi Hung

Choi Hung is one of the biggest public transport interchange. Many bus routes going to Kwun Tong will stop at Choi Hung. Also MTR Kwun Tong Line stops at there also. Look for bus routes that stops at Choi Hung / Ngau Chi Wan BBI.

91M and 91 going to UST stop at both Pik Hoi House (Choi Hung BBI) and Ngau Chi Wan Village (Ngau Chi Wan BBI). While 91P (Availble in morning and evening peak time only) will only stops at Ngau Chi Wan Village (Ngau Chi Wan BBI). It is possible to make a walk from Choi Hung BBI to Ngau Chi Wan BBI by walking inside Choi Hung Estate. It will take around 10 minutes.
