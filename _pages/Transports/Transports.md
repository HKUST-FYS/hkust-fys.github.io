## Going To HKUST

### Diamond Hill and Choi Hung

Choi Hung is one of the biggest public transport interchange. Many bus routes going to Kwun Tong will stop at Choi Hung. MTR Kwun Tong Line stops at there also. Look for bus routes that stops at Choi Hung / Ngau Chi Wan BBI. The following shows a list of bus stops under Choi Hung / Ngau Chi Wan BBI for your reference.

## Leaving HKUST

There are two bus stops in HKUST campus, namely HKUST (North) and HKUST (South). HKUST (North) is close to atrium, while HKUST (South) is close to Shaw Auditorium. The north one is for bus routes going to Sai Kung and TKO area (Po Lam, Hang Hau, Tseung Kwan O, Clear Water Bay, Sai Kung), while the south one is for bus routes going to Kowloon district (Choi Hung, Diamond Hill, Ngau Tau Kok, Mong Kok).

Before you leave HKUST, don't forget to tap your Octopus on the KMB Fare Savers near Lift 1 if you are leaving HKUST with KMB. You will save at most $4.

Shuttles are also provided in the evening. The shuttle stop is at Atrium (For Diamond Hill and Tseung Kwan O direction), or close to [Lo Kwee-Seong Building](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5ey1MwhHzaZWiF4cA) (For all other shuttles).

## üö∂ Healthy Lifestyle: Going to HKUST on foot

Actually, you can walk to HKUST by foot, from Hang Hau or Po Lam (You better not walk from Choi Hung). If you walk from Hang Hau, you will be walking along Sheung Ning Road, Ying Yip Road and Clear Water Bay road. It will take around 40 minutes. You can also choose to walk along the Duckling Hill (È¥®‰ªîÂ±±), which I personally do not recommend since it's a bit tiring.

If you start from [Po Lam](_pages/Transports/Po_Lam_To_UST.md), you will be crossing Metro City Plaza to go to Yau Yue Wan Customs Staff Tower (È≠∑È≠öÁÅ£Êµ∑Èóú‰∫∫Âì°ÂÆøËàç). You will see an entrance that can guide you to go to the mountain. It will take around 20 minutes, provided if you have some experience in mountain climbing (Not too difficult but quite tiring).
