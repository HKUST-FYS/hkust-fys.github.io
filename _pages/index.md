Welcome to the homepage!

We aim to provide a platform for all UST students to know about anything about UST, especially about program pathways, courses, instructors, activities provided, societies and maybe even sources, gossips. This platform is editable for everyone, but we, HKUST FYS DISCORD members are going to be the pioneers. If you are reading this, feel free to complete this enormous jigsaw puzzle with us!
