title: Gold Rice Bowl(GRB) Rumors
---

It is said that people will get diarrhea after eating in [Gold Rice Bowl](../places/on_campus/restaurant/Gold_Rice_Bowl.md). Some have this experience, while some don't. My personal thought is maybe the Dan Dan Noodle and other mala cuisines are too spicy for those who's digestive system is not used to.

But the mat in front of the counter is real sticky ðŸ¤®.
