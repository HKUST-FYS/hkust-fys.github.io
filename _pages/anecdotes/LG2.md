LG2 is not accessible by [Lift 10-12](), so there are many stories around it.
Some said LG2 is left empty because of the ghost of dead contruction workers were haunting there.
Some said it is for protecting the heritage safe from demolished by the building of campus.
Some said you can only access there through breaking the wall of the end of a toilet in LG1.

But actually, you can reach there through [Lift 6]() and it is just a floor for car park.
