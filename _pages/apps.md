## HKUST iLearn

HKUST iLearn is a mobile app that literally only provides three buttons that go to three locations: Canvas, Student Feedback Questionnaire, and iPRS. Mostly useless maybe save for the iPRS one. But you can access them from the browser anyway, see below.

The app is actually a web view showing <https://ilearn.ust.hk/>. So you can visit said link in your browser instead of downloading the app. For iPRS, the link is <https://prsmob.ust.hk/>.
