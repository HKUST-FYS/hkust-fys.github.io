## HKUST iLearn

HKUST iLearn is a mobile app that literally only provides three buttons that go to three locations: Canvas, Student Feedback Questionnaire, and iPRS. Literally useless maybe save for the iPRS one. Though you can access iPRS using your browser by going to <https://prsmob.ust.hk/> which redirects to <https://prsmob.ust.hk/ars/mobile/home/others>. However, they will not tell you this...
