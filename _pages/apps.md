## HKUST iLearn

HKUST iLearn is a mobile app that literally only provides three buttons that go to three locations: Canvas, Student Feedback Questionnaire, and iPRS. Literally useless maybe save for the iPRS one. Though you can access iPRS using your browser by going to [https://prsmob.ust.hk/](https://prsmob.ust.hk/) which redirects to [https://prsmob.ust.hk/ars/mobile/home/others](https://prsmob.ust.hk/ars/mobile/home/others). However, they will not tell you this...

## Canvas Student

Canvas Student is the most commonly used online learning system which allows you to check out the enrolled course and course related information, such as assignments, lecture notes, RVC (Lecture Recordings) and announcements. You can either download this app on your phone or visit https://canvas.ust.hk/.

## HKUST Student

[HKUST Student](https://studentapp.hkust.edu.hk/) is an official-developed app that provides various functions: e-identity, timetable, view course grade, booking system and list goes on. However, this app quit unexpectedly and frequently and it lacks features that USThing has. For that reason, UST students will not recommend this.

## USThing

[USThing](https://usthing.xyz/) is a student-developed app which provides similar functions like HKUST Student does. However, the majority of students choose to use this app instead of the previous one as this is more user-friendly compared with the previous one. Of course, you can try out both of them and decide which one to be your toolkit.

## DUO Security

DUO is somewhat like Google Authenticator whenever you want to log in your ITSC account with new equipment, you need this to verify your identity.

## Secure Access

Normally you will not need to use this app, unless there are some systems that require you to connect with on-campus network [(_eduroam_)](https://itsc.hkust.edu.hk/services/general-it-services/wifi/wi-fi-services/configuration-eduroam).

You can check [webpage](https://itsc.hkust.edu.hk/services/cyber-security/vpn) if you wish.

> Virtual Private Network ( VPN ) Service provides a method of securing communications between your Computers / Mobile Devices and HKUST Network from off-campus using the public Internet.
