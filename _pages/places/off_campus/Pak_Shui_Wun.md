A very nice beach next to [HKUST]()'s [Seafront](). The beach is semi-managed by an organic farm, 綠田園. Sometimes they hold events like wedding, school visitings, kayaking, etc. They offer shipping service for their visitors as well.

It can be accessed through the staircase in [North Gate](../chapter0/North_Gate.md) next to the station of minibus route [12]().

You may also see a 30m tall waterfall, especially during wet season on the trail to Pak Shui Wun.
