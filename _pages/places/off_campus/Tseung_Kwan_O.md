Both [Tiu Keng Leng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiu_Keng_Leng_station) and [Tsueng Kwan O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseung_Kwan_O_station) have MTR stations. You can take bus route [792M](https://mobile.citybus.com.hk/nwp3/?f=1&ds=792M--Sai_Kung&l=1) towards HKUST here, but it is less frequent than other routes.
