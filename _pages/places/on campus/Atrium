## Atrium 

The main lobby of [HKUST](). The sheltered area opposing to [Redbird Sundial](Redbird_Sundial). 

It is connecting to [Academic Concourse](Academic_Concourse), [Library](Library), [LG1]() (down), [Mushroom](Mushroom). 

It is where large scale activities take place, for example [Promotion Period](), [Alumniâ€™s Day](), [Garage Sale]()... and many other pop-up events. 

It can be very windy due to the convection between [Piazza]() and [Mushroom](Mushroom). Although there is a glass roof above, it is not fully covered, so it may leak water during heavy raining days.

Since it is an iconic place in [HKUST](), students usually pick up and meet their friends here.
