## Atrium 

The main lobby of HKUST. The sheltered area opposing to [Redbird Sundial] <>. 

It is connecting to [Academic Concourse](), [library](), [LG1]() (down), [Mushroom] (). 

It is where large scale activities take place, for example [Promotion Period](), [Alumniâ€™s Day](), [Garage Sale]()... and many other pop-up events. 

It can be very windy due to the convection between [piazza]() and Mushroom (Mushroom). Although there is a glass roof above, it is not fully covered, so it may leak water during heavy raining days.

Since it is an iconic place in HKUST, students usually pick up and meet their friends in there.
