It's located in LG7. It provide Hongkongese dishes like Siu Mei (燒味) and Two dishes rice / This This Rice (兩餸飯), and more.

## Lunch and Dinner

### Siu Mei (燒味)

The quality is sastifactory. You can pick one or two dishes from BBQ Pork (叉燒), Red Sausage (紅腸), Roasted Duck (燒鴨), Soy Sauce Chicken (油雞), Chicken (切雞). The price is `$27` and `$29` for one and two dishes Siu Mei Rice respectively in Lunch period. However, the price will be raised to `$41` and `$43` in dinner time. Soup and steamed vegetable will be included in the dinner combo set. You may also pick `$36` BBQ Pork Combo Rice or `$38` Fried Pork Combo Rice with a wider array of dishes. All Siu Mei sets include a hot drink for free.

### Two dishes rice (兩餸飯)

You can pick two dishes (`$30`) or three dishes (`$38`) from 4-6 choices. Meat are usually fine but vegetable have a strange smell. Free hot drinks also included. It is recommended to pick some dishes with more sauce as the food they used are not really fresh. Just try out different dishes.

### Curry

There are usually yellow or white curry with chicken or pork chop. The chicken or pork are quite nice, but the sauce is too spicy (for me at least) and the curry taste is quite minimal.

### Baked Rice / Spagetti (焗飯/焗意)

The quality is Schrödinger's cat. It could be really good or really bad. From my observation, the ones with Ketchup are usually better. Price is usally between `$28` - `$34`. Quite cheap considering its amount.

## Breakfast and Tea

Compare to dinner, the quality of breakfast and tea are suprisingly quite nice. You can get yourself a full combo set within `$30`. They are usually macaroni, noodles with chicken chops, eggs, ham, SPAM, sausage, bacon, bread, fried fish, fried porkchop, fries etc. The dishes varies over time so just visit and see if it's suit you. Recommended to try it out!
