It is located in 1/F. It offers cheap spaghetti, burgers, fries and coffee.

### Daily lunch set (lunch, dinner)

They offer '$36' daily lunch set with different consists everyday. They are usually rice/spagetti served with some meat and sauce.
The quality of Beef and Chicken are quite high (in UST) but pork is quite average.
A good thing of Diner is you can request additional rice, spagetti or sauce for free!

### Baked Rice and spagetti

Don't try the baked rice/spagetti as they are premade, cold and tastes terrible.

### All day breakfast

Quality is quite average but they are cheap (38-50) compare to other restaurants around the metroplitian

### Other

No harm trying I guess?
