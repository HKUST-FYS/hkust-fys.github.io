It is located in 1/F. It offers cheap spaghetti, burgers, fries and coffee.<br>
They usually offer a few $36 lunch set (as of Feb 2025) like rice served with pork chop /w sauce and spagetti with some sauce and meat<br>
A good thing of American Diner is that you are welcomed to switch between rice and spagetti, you may also request the staff to adjust the amount of sauce and/or rice/spagetti.<br>
All day Breakfast is average but, hey, it's cheaper than most of the restaurant outside of UST!<br>
$7 for a soup <br>
<br>
Baked rice/spagetti are not recommended as they are premade and taste terrible.<br>
