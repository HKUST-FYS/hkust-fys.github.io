## Gold Rice Bowl (GRB, 金兜)
Probably you may have heard from your seniors, saying how bad the food is, or [how they get diarrhea after having the food from GRB](GRB_rumor.md). However, this never happens to me. To be fair, GRB's food is not that bad, if you only consider their Dan Dan noodles (擔擔麪) and Choice of two/three dishes (兩餸/三餸飯). I do not make comments on other foods since they are not that popular. (When compared with Dan Dan noodles and Choice of n dishes. Just go to there and see how long the queue is.)


GRB starts at 10:45am. If you come early (Before 11:15am) then you do not need to queue.

### Dan Dan Noodles (擔擔麪)

Dan Dan Noodles is one of the best food provided in UST. The price varies from \$34 to \$~50, depends on what dish do you want. Take a look at the menu. I personally recommends 金錢肚 and 荔醋排骨. Or, just the most basic one, 肉燥擔擔麪. You can add noodles if you need to, but you need to pay \$5 extra. Remember, if you want extra noodles, do not use the kiosk. Go to counter directly and tell the staff you want extra noodle.

### Choice of two/three dishes (兩餸/三餸飯)

Choice of n dishes is also famous for it's good quality and its large portion. The price for two dish is \$29, while three dish is \$35. If you wish, you can request for extra rice with \$1. This can be done on both kiosk and counter. Personally, I suggest their chicken leg (雞髀) and bean sprout (芽菜)(Spicy). If you come quite early, say before 11am, you can also try their scrambled eggs and shrimp (蝦仁炒蛋). That is also really nice.
