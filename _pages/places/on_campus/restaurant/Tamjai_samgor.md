It is located in LG7. Newly launched in 2024/9. This is exactly the same Tamjai Samgor you have in other districts in HK. As a chain store, the offered meals are quite similiar to other Tamjai Samgor.

### Daily set

They will offer some budget meals with a price varies from `$42` to `$50` ish? Those meals come with a can of soft drink. You need to pay `$3` and `$5` to upgrade your drink to hot drinks and cold drinks respectively. The toppings and soup of those meals are fixed

### Mixian with optional toppings (自選米線)

The toppings offered are listed below: <br>

You are free to add as many toppings as you like if you are rich enough. However, if you want many toppings, I would recommend you to try "Cross-Bridge Mixian" (過橋米線)

### Cross-Bridge Mixian (過橋米線)

An expensive one, but worthy as it have many toppings:
Pork (豬肉), Ham (火腿), Fish Ball (魚蛋), Minced Pork (乍醬), Bean Curd Sheets (腐皮), Chinese Chives (韭菜), Beef (牛肉), Beef Ball (牛丸), Cuttlefish Ball (墨丸), Green Bean Sprouts (芽菜), Bean Curd Puffs (豆卜), Bamboo Fungus (竹笙), Chicken (雞肉), Pork Belly (腩肉), Pork Liver (豬膶), Pickled Cabbage (酸菜), Lettuce (生菜)

### Snacks

You may also pay a little more for some snacks. The undoubtably BEST one is Hunan Cumin Chicken Wings / TuFei Chicken Wings (土匪雞翼). You can share with your peers or yourself, yum!
Here's the menu for snacks: <br>
