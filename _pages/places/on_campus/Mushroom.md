title: Mushroom （蘑菇）
---

The balcony outside [atrium](Atrium.md). It got the name from the appearance of its exit. You can see the scenery of [Port Shelter]() clearly there. The convection of the air from [Mushroom]() and [Piazza]() made [Atrium](Atrium.md) windy. During [misty days](), the mist will rush into [Atrium]() through [Mushroom](Mushroom.md). Students like to joke about they would [jump off the mushroom]() when they are not in a good mood.
