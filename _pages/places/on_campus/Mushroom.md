title: Mushroom （蘑菇）
---
The balcony outside [Atrium](Atrium.md). It got the name from the appearance of its exit. You can see the scenery of [Port Shelter]() clearly there. The convection of the air from [Mushroom](Mushroom.md) and [Piazza]() made Atrium windy. During [misty days](), the mist will rush into Atrium through Mushroom. Students like to joke about they would [jump off the mushroom]() when they are not in a good mood.

The mushroom is facing the East, you can view nice sunrise and [moonrise](/_pages/nature/Night.md) here.
