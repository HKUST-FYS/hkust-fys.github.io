## Redbird Sundial （火雞）

The icon of HKUST. It is located in [Piazza](). A sculpture that can work as a sundial. You can only see what time it is by going up the floor and look through the windows in offices during sunny days.

According to [HKUST's official site]<https://hkust.edu.hk/visit/campus-highlights>, "Officially called the “Circle of Time”, it is often called the “Red Bird”. Commissioned by the Hong Kong Jockey Club and created by Irish-born Australia-based sculptors Charles and Joan Walsh-Smith, it was installed in 1991. The center piece is a sundial, one of the earliest scientific inventions which tells time by sunrays. The sculpture is made of steel and mounted on a paved podium of broad steps in the center of a pool of flowing water, symbolizing the passage of time. The podium incorporates a carved mural depicting 39 ancient Chinese accomplishments in all fields of science and technology." [1]

Visitors are allowed to stand on the stand to take pictures, but is prohibited to climb onto the sculpture, although many students and graduates may attempt to do so.
