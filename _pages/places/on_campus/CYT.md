鄭裕彤樓 ("C"heng "Y"u "T"ong Building).

Lift 35-37 are located in here.

For the G/F, there is a lecture theatre:[LT-L](), classrooms: from Room G001 to G016, and [Subway](/_pages/places/on_campus/restaurant/Subway.md).

For the UG/F, there are classrooms from UG001(A/B/C) to UG002(A/B).

For the 1/F, there are labs and the [skywalk pathway](/_pages/strategies/skywalk.md).

For the 2/F and above are labs, but outside the labs, there are some plugs, tables and seats and big French windows. You can consider there as a soothing study area.
