The main lobby of [HKUST](/_pages/places/chapter0/HKUST_content.md). The sheltered area opposing to [Redbird Sundial](Redbird_Sundial.md).

It is connecting to [Academic Concourse](Academic_Concourse.md), [Library](Library.md), [LG1]() (go down), [Mushroom](Mushroom.md).

It is where large scale activities take place, for example [Promotion Period](), [Alumniâ€™s Day](), [Garage Sale]() and many other pop-up events.

It can be very windy due to the convection between [Piazza]() and Mushroom. Although there is a glass roof above, it is not fully covered, so it may leak water during [heavy raining days](HKUST-FYS/hkust-fys.github.io/_pages/nature/bad_weather).

Since it is an iconic place in HKUST, students usually pick up and meet their friends here.
