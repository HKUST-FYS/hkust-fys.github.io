## The Hong Kong University of Science and Tecnology (HKUST)
[A university](https://hkust.edu.hk/) with the address "Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong". It was [forced into Kowloon](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hk/%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8#cite_note-%E9%A6%99%E6%B8%AF%E7%A7%91%E6%8A%80%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%B8%E5%9C%B0%E5%9D%80%E5%AF%AB%E6%B3%95-2) even though it is geographically in the New Territories because "Clear Water Bay" sounds nicer than "Tai Po Tsai".
