## Mushroom （蘑菇）

The balcony outside [atrium](). It got the name from the appearance of the exit. You can see the scenery of Port Shelter clearly there. The convection of the air outside mushroom and outside piazza is the reason why atrium is so windy. During misty days, the mist will rush into atrium through mushroom. Students here like to joke about they would [jump off the mushroom]() when they are not in a good mood.

The mushroom is facing the East, you can view nice sunrise and [moonrise](Night) here.
