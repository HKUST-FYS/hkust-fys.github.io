## Atrium 

The main lobby of HKUST. The sheltered area opposing to [Redbird Sundial](). 

It is connecting to [Academic Concourse](Academic COncourse), [library](Library), [LG1]() (down), [Mushroom](Mushroom.md). 

It is where large scale activities take place, for example [Promotion Period](), [Alumniâ€™s Day](), [Garage Sale]()... and many other pop-up events. 

It can be very windy due to the convection between [piazza]() and [Mushroom](Mushroom). Although there is a glass roof above, it is not fully covered, so it may leak water during [heavy raining days](bad_weather.md).

Since it is an iconic place in [HKUST](HKUST_content.md), students usually pick up and meet their friends in there.
