## Night

You can see moon rise in [mushroom](/_pages/places/on_campus/Mushroom.md) as [mushroom](/_pages/places/on_campus/Mushroom.md) is facing the East.

During nice weather, you can see plenty of stars at [Seafront](), especially after 2 a.m. when the street lights are off.

During [Autumn]() to [Spring](), you can see blue light at the edge of the sea due to commercial fishing at the border water.
