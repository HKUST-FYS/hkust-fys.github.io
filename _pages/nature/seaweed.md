It blooms during winter to early spring in [seafront](). Apparently, the species belongs to [*Sargassaceae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargassaceae). The texture is not really edible, since the fibre is too strong (don't ask me how I know). There are also some edible seaweed found in seafront reported by [Dr. Cynthia Yau](https://facultyprofiles.hkust.edu.hk/profiles.php?profile=sin-ting-cynthia-yau-cynthiastyau).

When there is full of seaweed, there is also full of [sea urchins](sea_urchin.md), because they eat seaweed. This editor has seen non-HKUSTer came to collect urchins during early Spring.

I don't recommend people to eat any creatures in seafront cuz it's full of trash.
