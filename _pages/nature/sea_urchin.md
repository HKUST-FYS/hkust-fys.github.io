## Sea Urchin
Nothing so special, just typical sea urchins. Probably the [purple sea urchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongylocentrotus_purpuratus) but I can't tell.

It is edible and some restaurants in Sai Kung even sell sea urchin fried rice (but I heard from my friend that it's quite expensive but they can't even see sea urchin in the dish.). During early spring, some uncles and aunties would come here to collect sea urchins.

I don't recommend people to eat any creatures in seafront cuz it's full of trash.
