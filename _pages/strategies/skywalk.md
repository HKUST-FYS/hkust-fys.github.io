Walking upstairs instead of walking on the regular path is called skywalk.
For most of the case, it means walking from the 1/F of [CYT](/_pages/places/on_campus/CYT.md) to 3/F in [Atrium](/_pages/places/on_campus/Atrium.md). Some people argued it was faster, but according to the [experiment](https://youtu.be/xokpOjKrvsg?si=ouuwDmGGtjlXnVHQ), this myth is debunked.

Since CYT and the whole academic building are connected, you can walk to anywhere even upstairs (As long as you don't get lost).

Other popular paths would be:
